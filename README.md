# GenomeSNPGraphing

This script takes an input reference fasta file and a stdout stream of NUCMER show-snp function. This function should be called with the parameters -qTHl. Output of this script includes bar graphs detailing the position of the SNPs and the relative number of SNPs per genomes sorted by time. Other outputs include coordinates for the sparse matrix and a dictionary with the order of the files and their corresponding [R] value as calculated by show-snps.
